    Backwards incompatible changes
    -------------------------------

        * Projects now has an associated owner, so old projects
          must be exported and imported to a new database.

    * Registering projects and uploading releases now requires
      authentication. Use the admin interface to create new users,
      registering users via distutils won't be available until
      :version:`0.3.0`.

    * Every project now has an owner, so only the user registering the
      project can add releases.

    * md5sum is now properly listed in the release link.

    * Project names can now have dots (`.`) in them.

    * Fixed a bug where filenames was mangled if the distribution file
      already existed. If someone uploaded version `1.0` of project `grail`
      twice, the new filename was renamed to `grail-1.0.tar_.gz`, and a
      backup of the old release was kept. Pip couldn't handle these filenames,
      so we delete the old release first.

    * Releases now list both project name and version, instead of just version
      in the admin interface.

    * Added a sample buildout.cfg. Thanks to Rune Halvorsen (runeh@opera.com).
